# Tic-Tac-game
This tic-tac-toe game will have an interface reproducing the classic three-by-three game board.
The players will take turns making their moves on a shared device. If a player wins, the game display will show a winning message with the mark (X or O).  The winning combination of cells will be highlighted on the board. Finally, the game’s File menu will have options to reset the game if you want to play again or to exit the game when you’re done playing.
